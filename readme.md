# Floatingman.nLoDash

Two things, build some C# functional tools and setting up a build pipeline on the _Azure DevOps_ site.

## The Code

For the code itself, I've leveraged [la-yumba](https://github.com/la-yumba/functional-csharp-code) and [LoDash](https://lodash.com/) for inspiration.

## The Infrastructure

This is standing mostly on out of the box _Azure DevOps_ documentation.
